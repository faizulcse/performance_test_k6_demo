Types of executors based on virtual users :
---------------------------------------------
1. per-vu-iterations: (Each VU executes an exact number of iterations) i.e ==> execute fixed sets of test data
2. shared-iterations: (A specific number of VUs to complete a fixed number of total iterations) i.e ==> time to complete iterations
3. constants-vus: (A specific number of VUs to run for a certain amount of time) i.e ==> for a specified amount of time
4. ramping-vus: (VUs need to ramp up or down during specific periods of time) i.e ==> for ramping up or down vus during specific periods of time

Types of executors based on iterations:
---------------------------------------------
1. constant-arrival-rate: i.e ==> fixed number of iterations over a specified period of time
2. ramping-arrival-rate: i.e ==> for ramping up or down iterations during specific periods of time
3. externally-controlled: i.e ==> control and scale execution at runtime via k6's REST API
NB: Don't use any sleep after iterations completed
